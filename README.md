# ethereumjs-abi

Module implementing the [Ethereum ABI](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI) in Javascript. Can be used with RPC libraries for communication or with ethereumjs-vm to implement a fully fledged simulator.

## Usage

#### Manual encoding and decoding

There are two methods of interest, ```rawEncode``` to encode a call (name plus arguments) and ```rawDecode``` to decode a response for a specific encoded query.

Example code:
```js
var abi = require('ethereumjs-abi')

// returns the encoded binary (as a Buffer) data to be sent
var encoded = abi.rawEncode("balanceOf", [ "address" ], [ "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" ])

// returns the decoded array of arguments
// need to define the input argument list in order to select the proper function
var decoded = abi.rawDecode("balanceOf", [ "address" ], [ "uint256" ], data)
```

For preparing encoded blocks without the signature, use ```rawEncodeResponse```. This can be useful when interfacing with contracts as a data provider.

#### Encoding and decoding aided by the JSON ABI definition

Planned for the future is supporting the JSON ABI definition:

```js
var abi = require('ethereumjs-abi')

// need to have the ABI definition in JSON as per specification
var tokenAbi = [{"constant":true,"inputs":[{"name":"","type":"address"}],"name":"balanceOf","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"name":"_to","type":"address"},{"name":"_value","type":"uint256"}],"name":"transfer","outputs":[{"name":"success","type":"bool"}],"type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"type":"constructor"}]

var encoded = abi.encode(tokenAbi, "balanceOf(uint256 address)", [ "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" ])

var decoded = abi.decode(tokenAbi, "balanceOf(uint256 address)", data)
```

#### Solidity *tightly packed* formats

This library also supports creating Solidity's tightly packed data constructs, which are used together with ```sha3```, ```sha256``` and ```ripemd160``` to create hashes.

Solidity code:
```js
contract HashTest {
  function testSha3() returns (bytes32) {
   address addr1 = 0x43989fb883ba8111221e89123897538475893837;
   address addr2 = 0;
   uint val = 10000;
   uint timestamp = 1448075779;

   return sha3(addr1, addr2, val, timestamp); // will return 0xc3ab5ca31a013757f26a88561f0ff5057a97dfcc33f43d6b479abc3ac2d1d595
 }
}
```

Creating the same hash using this library:
```js
var abi = require('ethereumjs-abi')
var BN = require('bn.js')

abi.soliditySHA3(
    [ "address", "address", "uint", "uint" ],
    [ new BN("43989fb883ba8111221e89123897538475893837", 16), 0, 10000, 1448075779 ]
).toString('hex')
```

For the same data structure:
* sha3 will return ```0xc3ab5ca31a013757f26a88561f0ff5057a97dfcc33f43d6b479abc3ac2d1d595```
* sha256 will return ```0x344d8cb0711672efbdfe991f35943847c1058e1ecf515ff63ad936b91fd16231```
* ripemd160 will return ```0x000000000000000000000000a398cc72490f72048efa52c4e92067e8499672e7``` (NOTE: it is 160bits, left padded to 256bits)

Note that ```ripemd160()``` in Solidity returns bytes20 and if you cast it to bytes32, it will be right padded with zeroes.

I am more than happy to receive improvements. Please send me a pull request or reach out on email or twitter.

There is a lot missing, grep for *FIXME* in the source code to find inspiration.
